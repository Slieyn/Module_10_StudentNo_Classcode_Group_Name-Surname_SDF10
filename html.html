                    <span>Let us break it down!</span></p>
                    <h4> Question 1:Application Programming Interface</h4>
                   <p> An API is a middleman between software applications, allowing them to communicate with one another.

                    It's  significance in software development is that it simplifys the creation of e.g, Web,desktop,
                    mobile and how they work.
                    Data is now shared easily, with guaranteed security. APIs are able to make certain information private;
                    as well as enhancing innovation and scalability as users are able to use these web applications and apps on 
                    desktops and mobiles. </p>
                    <h4> Example: Resturant</h4>
                    <p>
                      <p>Waiter >> API >> Kitchen >> Final Product</p>
            
                       <p>(Point of contact >> POS Machine >> Order Placed >> Dish)</p>
            
                       In this example a customer walks into a resturant, he sits done and is given a menu to choose from.
                       A waiter comes back and takes his order, writes it on a notebook. The waiter orders
                       via the POS(Point of Sale Machine),which then produces a slip to the kitchen staff(Chef) listing what the cutomer has ordered.
                       
                       Now, bare in mind that the customer does not have any idea of how his food is made,he only cares about the final product.
                       The Kitchen staff plays a huge role here because they are the ones that need to have the correct ingrediants and methods on 
                       how to create the dish. 
            
                       Once the dish has been prepared, the waiter then takes the dish to the table, and the customer is served
                    </p>

                        <p class="text-title">Question 2:Interface VS API?
                        <span>What is an Interface?</span></p>
                        <p>An Interface allows one to be in control. Now the advantage of Interface is that it is user-friendly. 
                            It provides the user with informable features on how to control devices, such as your remote control, 
                            volume button and simply turning the lights on and off.
                            Interface provides both physical and software ways of communication for users to interact with objects.
                            The most amazing thing about an Interface is that, they take away implementation. As users we do not have to worry 
                            about how the TV turns on and off when we click the power button. Interface takes care of it! It has simplified life.
                  </p>
                  <h4> What is an API?</h4>
                  <p>"Application Programming", These are tools designed for develpers to create websites and applications. I call them 
                    Ready made code. For example, an easy mix for muffins.
                    APIs assist us in accomplishing tasks without worrying about how it was created. We only have to undertand 
                    implementation to match the frameworks.
          
                    So the difference between the two is that Interface does not require implementation, yet AP requires 
                    an understanding of implementation. </p>

                    <p class="text-title">Question 3:
                    <h4>Question 3:Components and Types of APIs</h4></p>
                    <h4>Main Components</h4>
                    <ul>
                       <li>EndPoint
                           An Endpoint is Locator. 
                           For example,when a clients requests a resource, they do it via an endpoint.
                           Which effectively states that the resource is available in a specific location.
                       </li>
                      <h4>Method</h4>
                       <li>These define the types of actions that can be 
                           executed against APIs Endpoints. 
                           Here are examples of the HTTP Method (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
                           <li>GET:Used to get data.</li>
                           <li>POST: Used to send data to the server.</li>
                           <li>PUT: Updates existing data.</li>
                           <li>PATCH: Used when changing certain information
                               for an email and not the actual user name.
                           </li>
                           <li>DELETE: Removing a resource</li>
                           </li>
                           <h4>DataFormats</h4>
                       <li>DataFormats are communicators.They usualy communicate using JSON. JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)
                        is a lightweight data format that easy to read and write. It's role is simplicity and effienency. 
                       </li>
                       </ul>
                       <h4>Types of APIs</h4>
                       <ul>
                           <li>WEB APIs, I call them Remote APIs</li>
                           These types of APIs operate and facilitate over the internet. For example,
                           Shazam,that is an app that allows us to identify a song by sound waves providing information, e.g the name
                           of the song and the artist. 
            
                           <li> REST OR RESTful, This type of API acts as a hat.
                               "Representational State Transfer"
                               REST allows the server to cater to mulltiple types of clients e.g mobile,web and desktop.
                               The main theme is "The serparations of concerns"
                               Meaning the client(browser) and the server(stores and retrives date) are 
                               kept separate from each other. Reason being for the browser to focus on the user interface while the 
                               server handles the data. 
                               "This principle is called the Client Server-Architecture"
            
                               Every request from a client contains all the information the server needs to understand and process the 
                               request. No session data is stored on the server between requests. 
                               "This principle is called Statelessness"
            
                               I find REST/RESTful useful because I find it useful! It enables scalability meaning 
                               there won't be any storing of information.Enhances simplicty, allowing requests to be handled independently
                               and flexability, allowing clients to send requests in any order without relying on prior requests. 
                           </li>  
                       </ul>

                        <p class="text-title">Question 4:?
                        <h4>Question 4:Practical Appication and Tools</h4></p>
                        <p>  APIs are important. I find them to be very useful. Code is complex on it's own and it evolves everyday. New things are discovered
                            everyday. Delving more into APIs as a junior developer, I believe it will make my developing journey easier. Yes, the is a lot to learn but with 
                            mastering the implementation of APIs,I will be able to create the best web apps and more. 
                            I love that it simplyfies everything. Less code, with fast and advanced creations.
                            I have used Youtube videos to guide me. 
                            I have praciticed and applied APIs on Spotify, which is a music platform. I discoverd that they accomodate developers. 
                            We are able to implement ideas with the help of APIs, I really found that to be an amazing opportunity.
                            Being able to constantly apply our ideas and skills as new developers in big platforms like Spotify. I am willing to learn more about
                            APIs and master the implementation of the frameworks.</p>

                                <h4>Question 5: Learning and implementation</h4></p>
                           <p>REST as well as the HTTP Methods.These are the areas I feel comfortable with when it comes to APIs. 
                            I have understood all the theory part of it yet I still need to put in more practice into it so that I can fully 
                            grasp the content.
                            I find it hard to work with Curl. I do undertand that it acts as a versetile command-line tool and library.
                            My basic understanding of it is that it lets developers transfer data across varios network protocols. The difficulty
                            I face is implementation. I need to pracice more on GitBash because Curl is available there. More pracitice wil give me 
                            more understanding and confidence to work on the platform.
